	<h1>Hi there, I am Joshua Ya!</h1>

	<p>Hi! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science. Currently, I am a Software Engineer Intern at Northrop Grumman working on the e.POWER product development team, as well as a Teaching Assistant in the CS Department at UVa. During the previous summer, I was an intern at General Dynamics IT working on moving infrastructure to the cloud (AWS). In high school, I was on the FTC Robotics team 519, where we made it to the World Championship in St. Louis, MO. When I am not at UVa, I am in Reston, VA hanging out with my lovely parents and sister. A few of my hobbies include running, biking, and eating, with eating being my favorite!</p>
