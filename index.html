I am an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science, as well as a Teaching Assistant in the CS Department at UVa. This past summer, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Northrop Grumman working on the e.POWER product development team. The summer before that, I was an intern at General Dynamics IT working on moving infrastructure to the cloud (AWS). In high school, I was on the FTC Robotics team 519, where we made it to the World Championship in St. Louis, MO. When I am not at UVa, I am in Reston, VA hanging out with my family and friends. A few of my hobbies include running, biking, and eating.<br/><br/></p>
