	<p>Basketball is one of my favorite sports to play and watch. What I love about basketball is that I have the chance to hone my skills on my own and feel individual improvement, but at the same time, playing on a team requires additional skills. In order to successfully play with others, I have to understand their personalities, their tendencies and their habits, which only come from experience playing as a team. Even with individual accolades, in the end, a great team requires selfless teamwork. </p>
		
	<h2>Running/Biking</h2>
	
	<p>I did Cross Country and Track in high school, and those experiences taught me how enjoyable running can be (at least when you’re in shape). Biking is also great, because are there are so many beautiful trails (like the W&OD) that are yet to be fully explored! And I like to set goals, so in order to stay motivated to run, I plan on doing a Sprint Triathlon in the near future. </p>
	
	<h2>Eating</h2>

	<p>As an Asian-America and someone who has taken other languages (Spanish and Korean), I have been exposed to a variety of cultures. The best of learning about other cultures is the food, especially seeing how that plays into their culture. Food tells a story about a group’s origins (e.g. rice as a staple food due to its abundance and versatility), which raises cultural awareness and understanding. So, I hope to eat new kinds of food wherever I go.</p>
	
	<h2>Music</h2>
	
	<p>My favorite times to listen to music are when I am laying on the bed or in the car on a long drive. I appreciate how music can fit so many emotions, where I can listen to upbeat music when I am feeling down and peaceful music when I need a break from the craziness of the day; there is something for everyone with music. I play the various instruments (piano, guitar, violin) and I hope to use my skills to encourage and connect with others.</p>
