	<p>Basketball is one of my favorite sports to play and watch. What I love about basketball is that I have the chance to hone my skills alone and feel individual improvement, but at the same time, playing on a team requires additional skills. In order to succeed playing with others, I have to understand their personalities, their tendencies and their habits, which only comes from experience playing as a team. Even with individual accolades, in the end, a great team requires selfless teamwork. </p>
		
	<h2>Running/Biking</h2>
	
	<p>I did Cross Country and Track in high school, and those experiences taught me how enjoyable running can be (at least when youâ€™re in shape). Biking is also great, because are there are so many beautiful trails (like the W&OD) that are yet to be fully explored! And I like to set goals, so in order to stay motivated to run, I plan on doing a Sprint Triathlon in the near future. </p>
