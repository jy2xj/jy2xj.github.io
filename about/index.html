			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hi! I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science. I am currently a Software Engineer Intern at Northrop Grumman working on the e.POWER product development team, as well as a Teaching Assistant in the CS Department at UVa. During the previous summer, I was an intern at General Dynamics IT working on moving infrastructure to the cloud (AWS). In high school, I was on the FTC Robotics team 519, where we made it to the World Championship in St. Louis, MO. I currently live in Reston, Virginia with my lovely parents and sister. In my free time, I enjoy running, biking, and eating.</p>
